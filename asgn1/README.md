### To use the script:

1. To set the executable bit of plot.sh, use chmod +x plot.sh.
2. To run the script, do ./plot.sh.
3. The output will be 4 pdfs of graphs using the Collatz Sequence.


### Description of assignment:

We are to make a shell script that can output the same graphs that assignment 1 asks for.
We are to also provide an interesting graph as well.


### Bugs:

I did not experience any bugs other than my own errors when figuring out the commands.


### Sources:

I used [gnuplot's official documentation](http://www.gnuplot.info/documentation.html) to get all necessary information.
I also used [this](http://lowrank.net/gnuplot/datafile3-e.html) to understand awk.
